## Brief about it

This is a local API forked from [bezkoder](https://github.com/bezkoder/node-js-jwt-auth-mongodb) that is edited to use on my [Authentication Login/Register](https://github.com/lirbre/auth-login-form) and make it functional for tests on localhost.

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run
```
node server.js
```
